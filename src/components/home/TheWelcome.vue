        <p class="text-lg my-4">
        Led by Dr. Francis Bordeleau at <a href="https://etsmtl.ca" target="_blank">École de technologie supérieure</a>  and in collaboration with industry partners Kaloom and <a href="https://www.telus.com/" target="_blank">TELUS</a>, the Kaloom-TELUS
        IRC investigate new DevOps engineering approaches that help software organizations design new IT
        services faster and more efficient than traditional methods. This allows them to react more quickly to
        the competitive environment, which is also currently marked by labour shortages.

        The DevOps methodology aims to optimize the workflow by creating value for the end user, from
        the initial idea to the deployment of the functionality. It reduces unnecessary tasks,
        accelerates the time to market for products and services, and increases their quality. It also
        builds on the collaboration between the various parties involved in the development of
        reliable, high-performance products.
